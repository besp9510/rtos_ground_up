There are three ways in which a periodic scheduler can be created

1. Create a background thread that periodically calls the period thread (a function).
   Use a timer and a interrupt service routine to service that timer to work along side
   the round-robin scheduler to periodically schedule a thread.
   - Use the systick round-robin scheduler
   - Create a timer for one periodic thread; the ISR servicing this timer will
     schedule the periodic thread. This timer is intended to be hardware timer
     found on the discovery board.
   - Keep the three threads scheduled
2. Change the systick round-robin scheduler to schedule the thread periodically
3. Create a thread control block that considers periodic scheduling
